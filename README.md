# Fingerprint_Attendance_System_with_Web_Based_Service

\\Summary:
This project presents a cost-effective wireless biometric attendance system having the fastest data transfer rate. It is more user friendly than the previous versions of any attendance system. The main focus is to develop an automated fingerprint based attendance system and also an information service system for an academic domain by using biometric technology in addition to the programmable logic circuit (Arduino) and web-based application. The system also includes Bluetooth technology for smooth operation and low costing. The capability to operate at both AC (Alternating Current) and DC (Direct Current) power sources makes this system more attractive and efficient.
\\Apparatus:
HC-05, FPM 10A, Arduino Uno, TTL, Power supply, Cooler fan, Lipo battery, Bug converter, Relay, Charger battery, Casing, Cod.
